# bashlib
## about
__bashlib__ is a collection of functions to help simplify and unify your shell scripts. As the name suggests, it is not targeted at a smallest common denominator like POSIX/sh but at [bash](http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html) (v4.x). Also, bashlib is not meant to become a complete solution for everything; you can read more about bashlib's goals in the mission statement (tbd).

That's it for starters, but there will be more documentation to come.
