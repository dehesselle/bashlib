# bashlib
## About
[bashlib](https://github.com/dehesselle/bashlib) __is__ my take on a collection of functions to ease the task of writing complex shell scripts. As the name suggests, it is specifically built around [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) (4.x). The main platform is Linux due to the usage of [GNU core utilities](https://http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils).

It __is not__ targeted at the lowest common denominator like POSIX/sh. Other platforms than Linux may or may not be more or less well supported.  
It's also far from being finished.

There is a design document that goes into more detail.

## Getting started
Right now I'd advise you to hold off for a little longer (to avoid frustration). There's a lot of documentation and real-world examples in the making, but it's not ready just yet.
